We want to create a hero craft system.

The idea behind that system is building your own kingdom. In your kingdom, you are the king, and build your army by crafting the strong hero (nft token).

## Craft strongest heroes

As a craftsman, you craft your new hero (mint a nft token).

You also can make a stronger hero fusion from two or more heroes.

## Expand your land by war

You can also fight with other kingdom.

If you win, you will get more land, heroes. Your heroes will grow up by war, means strenthen the atk and hp.

If you lose, you must to contribute a part of your land, and some heroes to the opponent as booty.

## Heroes store

You can buy or sell heroes here.

Coupon may be applied to get better price.

## Limitation

It is also lack of converter between many data types. So it also makes things more difficulty.
